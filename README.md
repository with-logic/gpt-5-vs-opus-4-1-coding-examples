This repository contains a six-way comparison of demo applications generated by **OpenAI's GPT-5**, **OpenAI's GPT-5.1**, **Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1**, **Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5**, **Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5**, and **Google's Gemini 3**, using identical prompts for each example.

This is a fork of [OpenAI's GPT-5 Coding Examples repository](https://github.com/openai/gpt-5-coding-examples), extended to include GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.1, Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 3 implementations of the same prompts for comparison purposes.

Each model was given the same natural language descriptions to scaffold websites, front-end applications, games, and interactive UIs — allowing for a direct comparison of their respective coding capabilities. All applications were generated in a single one-shot prompt, without any manual code editing.

## Repository Structure

- **`/gpt-5-apps`** - Applications generated by GPT-5
- **`/gpt-5.1-apps`** - Applications generated by GPT-5.1
- **`/opus-4.1-apps`** - Applications generated by Claude Opus 4.1
- **`/opus-4.5-apps`** - Applications generated by Claude Opus 4.5
- **`/sonnet-4.5-apps`** - Applications generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **`/gemini-3-apps`** - Applications generated by Gemini 3
- **`/examples`** - YAML files containing the prompts used for all models
- **`/front-end`** - Web interface for browsing and comparing the examples

## Explore Examples

You can explore the demos by cloning this repo and running it locally.

```
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `localhost:3000`.

From there, you can view examples from all six models side-by-side, see the prompts that created the code, and compare the different approaches taken by each AI model.

## Build Your Own

You can experiment with these same prompts using any of the six models:

### Using GPT-5 / GPT-5.1

- **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)** – Choose GPT-5 or GPT-5.1 to generate and preview code in the browser
- **Your favorite IDE or coding tool** – Use GPT-5/5.1 within your existing workflow to generate and refine code
- **API** – Access GPT-5/5.1 through OpenAI's API for programmatic generation

### Using Claude Opus 4.1

- **[Claude](https://claude.ai)** – Use Claude Opus 4.1 in the browser interface
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** – A lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal
- **API** – Access Claude Opus 4.1 through Anthropic's API for programmatic generation

### Using Claude Opus 4.5

- **[Claude](https://claude.ai)** – Use Claude Opus 4.5 in the browser interface
- **[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** – A lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal
- **API** – Access Claude Opus 4.5 through Anthropic's API for programmatic generation

### Using Claude Sonnet 4.5

- **API** – Access Gemini 3 through Google's API for programmatic generation

Choose an example from the `/examples` directory, copy its prompt for inspiration, and adapt it to your own needs. All six models can scaffold complete applications from natural language descriptions.

## Comparison Highlights

All six models demonstrate strong capabilities in:
- Single-file HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications
- Interactive games and animations
- Data visualization and dashboards
- Responsive design and modern UI patterns
- Complex state management and user interactions

The six-way comparison reveals interesting differences in:
- Code organization and structure
- Design aesthetics and UI choices
- Implementation approaches for the same functionality
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling strategies

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is for **comparison and research purposes**. All applications were generated in a single prompt without manual editing, showcasing the raw capabilities of each model.
